I innovate, and get things done! that's the story of my life. 

And yeah, that's all about me :)

In this blog I will be writing primarily about my learning on:

1. **Backend Engineering - Java**
2. **System Design, DSA**
3. **...and little philosophy**

All posts assume no, or little, prior knowledge of the subject matter and therefore should be useful regardless of your level of experience.

I am currently building backend software at [Safaricom PLC](https://www.safaricom.co.ke)
