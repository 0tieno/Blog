![Microsoft MVP award](./images/2025/12/MVP_Badge_Horizontal_Preferred_Blue3005_RGBcopy.jpg)

Hey! I’m Ronney, a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/b9a24a24-7cfe-489e-8a76-4a0ad03a3444) MVP (Cloud Security & DevSecOps) and a backend architect & engineer. I build secure cloud-native products some of which supports thousands of users daily. I love innovation and getting stuff done.

And yeah, that's all about the story of my life :)

In this blog I will be writing primarily about my learning on anything:

1. Backend Software Architecting & Engineering
2. Security in Software and Cloud

All posts assume no, or little, prior knowledge of the subject matter and therefore should be useful regardless of your level of experience.

I am currently building backend software at [Safaricom PLC](https://www.safaricom.co.ke)
