I have NO other higher calling in this life below than to transform people's lives. If I do but one thing today, may I be human sunshine for someone.

In this blog I will be writing primarily about my learning:

1. **Backend Software Engineering**
2. **System Design, DSA**
3. **...and philosophy**

All posts assume no, or little, prior knowledge of the subject matter and therefore should be useful regardless of your level of experience.

I am currently building backend software at [Safaricom PLC](https://www.safaricom.co.ke)

Perhaps you've used a software I have built
