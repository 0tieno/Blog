Hello! I'm Ronney, a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/b9a24a24-7cfe-489e-8a76-4a0ad03a3444) (Cloud Security & DevSecOps).:)

In this blog I will be writing primarily about my learning on anything:

- Backend Software, cloud, and DevOps, and their matter Security

All posts assume no, or little, prior knowledge of the subject matter and therefore should be useful regardless of your level of experience.

I am currently building backend software at [Safaricom PLC](https://www.safaricom.co.ke)
