Important part of programming is solving problems efficiently. In order to do that, you need to know algorithms. In our previous post about [data structures and algorithms](/Blog/java-data-structures/), we discussed data structures. Now, let's dive into algorithms!

An algorithm is a procedure to solve a problem.

Common algorithms include `searching`, `sorting`, `iterating`, and finding `min/max`.

Algorithms are used to solve problems by sorting, searching, and manipulating data structures(ArrayList, HashMap, Hashset, etc.)

Algorithms work together with data structures to make your programs more powerful and efficient.

Happy hacking!
