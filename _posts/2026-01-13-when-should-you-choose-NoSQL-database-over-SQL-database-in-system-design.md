In our yesterday's post, [When Should You Choose SQL Database Over NoSQL Database in System Design?](/Blog/when-should-you-choose-SQL-database-over-NoSQL-database-in-system-design), we discussed scenarios favoring SQL databases. Today, we will explore when a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Cassandra is the better choice over a SQL database like MySQL or PostgreSQL in system design.

Scenarios:

1. High Scalability: If your machine wishes to handle a large amount of records and visitors, NoSQL databases provide horizontal scalability, making them a top desire for net and mobile programs.
2. Flexible Schema: When your information structure is dynamic and may evolve through the years, NoSQL databases with schema-less designs permit for simpler version.
3. Real-time Analytics: For real-time analytics and processing of streaming facts, NoSQL databases are frequently the favored option due to their pace and versatility.

Happy Learning!
