Comic artist and graphic designer Mirko Ilic reminds us that `nothing beats working on the right thing`:

INTERVIEWER: "What is your best tip for saving time?"

ILIC: "Think 8 hours, work 2 hours"

Designing a software system is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors to ensure the system is robust, scalable, and maintainable. Here are some important points to consider when designing a software system:

1. Scalability: The system should be designed to handle increased loads and be able to scale horizontally or vertically as needed.
2. Performance: The system should be designed to perform efficiently and effectively, with minimal latency and response time.
3. Reliability: The system should be reliable and available, with minimal downtime or system failures.
4. Security: The system should be designed with security in mind, including measures to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.
5. Maintainability: The system should be designed to be easy to maintain and update, with clear documentation and well-organized code.
6. Interoperability: The system should be designed to work seamlessly with other systems and components, with clear and well-defined interfaces.
7. Usability: The system should be designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clear and consistent user interface.
8. Cost-effectiveness: The system should be designed to be cost-effective, with a focus on minimizing development and operational costs while still meeting the requirements.

By considering these important points when designing a software system, an engineer can create systems that are `robust`, `scalable`, and `maintainable`, while also `meeting the needs of users` and stakeholders.

Pause a moment and look at your body architecture! Appreciate the `Chief Architect`!

Happy designing!
