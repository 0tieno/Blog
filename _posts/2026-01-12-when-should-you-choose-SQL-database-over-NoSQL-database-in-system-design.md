In this post, we will explore the scenarios where choosing a SQL database like MySQL or PostgreSQL is more advantageous than opting for a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Cassandra in system design.

Scenarios:

1. Complex Queries: If your application requires advanced queries and complex reporting, SQL databases excel in this area because of their structured schema and SQL query language.
2. Data Integrity: When data consistency and integrity are paramount, particularly in financial or regulatory applications, SQL databases with ACID compliance are the preferred choice.
3. Transactions: SQL databases are the go-to option for applications that require support for multi-step, ACID-compliant transactions, like e-commerce systems.
