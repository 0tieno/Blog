Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language. But what does that mean?

That means that everything in java is an object. An object is an instance of a class. A class is a blueprint (constructor) for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors of the objects (methods).

For example, consider a class named `Car`. The `Car` class can have properties like `color`, `model`, and `year`, and methods like `start()`, `stop()`, and `drive()`. When you create an object of the `Car` class, like `audi`, you can set its properties and call its methods.

some advantages of Object-oriented programming are:

- OOP is faster and easier to execute
- OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
- OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
- OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

> Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

That was a lot of information! In the next post, we will explore the in depth the java `classes` and `objects`.


Happy hacking!
